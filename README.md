# AzureDevOps Exercise
Created 6/22/2021

## Description
My client at the time of creating this repo was in the process of migrating things from on-premesis to Azure. They were also looking to shed their older on-premesis CI/CD solution in favor of the release management system on Azure DevOps. Since creating a whole new solution for them was not too far off I decided to take some time outside of work and gain some experience using Azure DevOps to get some applications into Azure.

## Applications
- Angular front end
- .NET 5 Web API back end
- SQL Server

The applications will be empty at the start due to the emphasis on CI and CD to Azure. Perhaps I will get something to implement in the applications as the requirements of my client's new solution becomes clear? 

## Tools and Technology
- GitHub Codespaces (Browser and VS Code)
- Angular
- SQL Server
- .NET 5
- Azure (App Services, Azure SQL, VNet)

## Progression
- [ ] Creation of applications, Azure infrastructure, and initial YAML pipelines
- [ ] Update to use Terraform to create Azure infrastructure as part of the YAML pipelines
- [ ] I haven't thought of this yet; It depends on how this whole new solution for my client comes into focus
